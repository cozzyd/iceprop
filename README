iceprop  
---------

My attempt at using meep (http://ab-initio.mit.edu/wiki/index.php/Meep) to simulate radio propagation in firn 
It should live at http://github.com/cozzyd/iceprop 

Cosmin Deaconu <cozzyd@kicp.uchicago.edu>


Requirements (for now): 
  meep (which requires guile and libctl. We don't use the hdf5 facilities of meep, so you can compile without that.) 
  ROOT  (tested with ROOT 6, but ROOT 5 might work) 
  libconfig 

Usage:
  You can either use it as a library (in e.g. a ROOT macro or your own compiled code) or with the iceprop driver macro + config files. 
  At some point I will write some documentation :) 

Units: 
  - Meep is dimensionless, so we are free to use our own units. 
  - Distance units are in meters. 
  - Cylindrical coordinates are used, where the transmitter is always at r=0. Negative z is below the ice surface, positive z is above. 
  - Time units are in ns, therefore frequency is in GHz. 
  - Electric field units are in Volts / m  (that implies current is in units of 1 / 377 A, I think).
